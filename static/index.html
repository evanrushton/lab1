	<h4>Project Portfolio</h4>

	<!-- p means paragraph -->
	<p>My name is Evan Rushton, I was teaching high school math for the past 8 years and currently am a member of the Learning, Design, and Technology (LDT) Masterâ€™s program in the GSE.

	I work in education to inspire our students and teachers to be passionate about their work. I love teaching and I joined this program because I want to contribute to the paradigm shift in teaching and learning occurring in the information age. John Hennessy is the president of Stanford University.  He takes HCI classes in his spare time.
